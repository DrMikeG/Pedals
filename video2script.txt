Here I have three keys printed and wired up to the teensie 4.0
There is a hall effects sensor for each key, and they key moves a magnet.
The teensie sends the appropriate midi code to garage band on the Mac, which turns that into an instrument sound.

It took a couple of hours to print and assembly a key mechanism, so I added two more over the next couple of days.

Any now the piano needs it's wooden pedal keys. I'm using white oak and sepele - they're are economic, ethical, and I already had some in stock.

I'm actually not very good at cutting small, identical bits of wood, so I used pretty much every trick and jig at my disposal.

One of the strange things I found is that, although I've never learned to play the piano, if I have something that even looks like a piano - my fingers want to play it. I expect at lot of people have that.

I am imagining this instrument will be played by socked-feet, so I'm adding some notches for friction.
I was a bit worried about feet slipping off the smooth pedal keys.

I was debating square front, versus round fronted keys, so whilst I deliberated, I cleaned up the workshop.
Then I committed to rounded fronts.

One of the benefits of having modelled the entire piece in CAD was that I was pretty confident of the sizing - but it was still very pleasant to see the keys in real life and not just in the computer modelled assembly.

In an effort to reduce costs, I based most of the design around m2.5 22mm fixings that I already have a huge bag of. The downside of this was that something I didn't have clearance for them, and needed to shorted them with bolt croppers. (Using a dremel got them too hot and melted the ABS printed parts)

And now a coating of Danish Oil on the keys. This is always quite a theroputic task.
